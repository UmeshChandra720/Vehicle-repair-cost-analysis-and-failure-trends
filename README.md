# Vehicle-repair-cost-analysis-and-failure-trends
Data-driven analysis of vehicle repair costs and failure trends to identify high-cost components, common failures, and cost-saving opportunities. Uses Python for data analysis, visualization, and predictive insights into repair expenses across different vehicle platforms.

Vehicle Repair Cost Analysis & Failure Trends

Project Overview

This project explores repair costs, failure trends, and key factors impacting expenses in vehicle maintenance. 
Using real-world service data, it identifies high-cost components, frequent failures, and platform-based repair trends to help manufacturers, dealerships, and customers optimize repair strategies.

Key Insights

✔️ BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) have the highest average repair cost (~$1600+).
✔️ Full-Size Trucks experience frequent and expensive part failures.
✔️ Newer vehicles surprisingly have higher repair costs than older ones.
✔️ Administrative & labor costs significantly impact total expenses.
✔️ Mileage alone doesn’t drive repair costs—part failures & warranty claims do.

Tech Stack & Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis & visualization

Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step analysis

GitHub for version control


Approach & Methodology

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.


2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis of repair costs, mileage, vehicle platforms, and failure rates.


3️⃣ Insights & Recommendations

Identified high-cost parts & expensive repairs in different vehicle categories.

Suggested ways to optimize labor costs & reduce administrative expenses.
